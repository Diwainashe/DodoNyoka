ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

    Always keep navbar.html and footer.html clean â€” remember they load into every page.

    Only use relative paths (assets/images/...) for images, not absolute URLs.

    The preloader animation uses LottieFiles (no downloads required).

    For adding new pages, simply create a new HTML file and include:
    <div id="navbar-container"></div>
    <!-- your page content here -->
    <div id="footer-container"></div>

    and everything will load automatically!
